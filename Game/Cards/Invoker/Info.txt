Invoker:
A competent wizard knows perhaps two spells; an exceptional one, three or four. Wielding the elements of Quas,
Wex and Exort, the Invoker surpasses them all. Forging Spirits of ice and fire to melt away the armor of enemies 
with great Alacrity while Snapping their heat-deprived cold bodies. 
Conjuring an Ice Wall to stop foes in their paths before vanishing into thin air, 
chilling nearby enemies like a Ghost Wandering through their ranks. 
Lifting enemies off the ground with a Tornado that reaches through half the battlefield, 
while charging up an Extractive Mana Pulse for the whirling foes to land into. 
Pulling down a gigantic Meteor from space to crush enemies along a path while at the same time 
unleashing a Deafening Blast to push them along meteor's path. And last but not least, 
predicting enemy movement and using the Sun to Strike enemies from anywhere on the map.
Whatever magic he chooses, one thing is certain: All shall come to bow before the Arsenal Magus.
