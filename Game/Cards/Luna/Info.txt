Luna:
Renouncing her savage past, Luna swore her service to Selemene, 
and embraced the title of Moon Rider. The goddess bestows a Lunar Blessing on her new champion, 
boosting her strength and heightening her nocturnal senses. Saddled on top of Nova, her beastly mount, 
Luna bounds across the Nightsilver Woods to smite trespassers with a searing Lucent Beam. 
Superior numbers are no advantage against the Moon Rider. Through divine will, 
the midday sun gives way to night, and every foe is struck by rays of lunar energy as 
Luna tears through their ranks with flying Moon Glaives. By Selemene's wrath or through her own hand, 
the Moon Rider levels the battlefield under the brief darkness of the Eclipse.
