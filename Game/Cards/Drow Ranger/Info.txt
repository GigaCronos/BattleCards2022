Drow Ranger:
Dwelling deep within the forest, few have ever caught glimpse of the solitary and impossibly beautiful Drow Ranger. 
Her presence was known only from the chill of Frost Arrows, 
driving deep into her enemies' hearts. Named and raised by the sympathetic Drow, 
Traxex draws on her heritage to send forth a powerful Gust, 
silencing and repulsing assailants who venture too close. Although normally aiming for precision, 
Traxex does not shy away from unorthodox methods, launching a rapid salvo of ice-tipped arrows 
at multiple targets at once. Honing her skill to peerless precision, 
the Drow Ranger's legendary Marksmanship only improves with each passing skirmish.
