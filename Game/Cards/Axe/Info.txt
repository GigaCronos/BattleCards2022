Axe:
One by one the soldiers of the Red Mist fell, some in battle, 
others to Mogul Khan's ambitions, until the self-declared general 
found himself a commander without troops. "No matter", Axe thought,
"For a one-man army is the best army of all." â€” Leaping into battle,
Mogul Khan compels nearby foes to attack him with a taunting Berserker's Call.
Absorbing blows from every direction, the indomitable Axe reacts by swinging
his axe full circle in a Counter Helix, easily dispatching the swarm he had gathered. 
But alas, not all stay long enough to meet their end. 
The few limping away from Mogul Khan feel an inexplicable Battle Hunger, 
a hunger never sated before Axe slams his Culling Blade through a weakened enemy, 
sending them to an early grave. Axe, Axe is always charging onward.
