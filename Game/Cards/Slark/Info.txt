Slark:
The only prisoner ever to escape from Dark Reef, Slark's abilities and ruthlessness are without equal. 
Pouncing into danger then slipping back out is what Slark does best. With every swing of his barnacle 
encrusted dagger, Slark steals his target's Essence, converting them to render himself more agile, 
striking harder and faster. He forges a Dark Pact, sacrificing his own lifeblood to dissipate negative 
energies that damage foes, and frees him from magical constraints. Concealing himself as he Dances 
through the Shadows, the Nightcrawler presents no visible target to would-be attackers. 
Hidden and Shrouded in this black haze, Slark escapes the inescapable and is always ready 
to to gut his enemies with little risk of retribution.
