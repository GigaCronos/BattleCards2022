Zeus:
Charged with godly might, a Static Field constantly surrounds Zeus, making enemies more susceptible to his lightning.
As the Lord of Heaven Jumping around, Zeus calls down Lightning Bolts to smite foes and reveal the surroundings, 
sends Arc of Lightning through his nearest enemies, and calls forth a terrifying Nimbus upon his enemies 
that repeatedly strikes enemies with Lightning Bolts. None can hide from Zeus, 
pointing his arms skyward to bring divine punishment down on each and every foe. 
Wherever they may be, none shall stand against the Thundergod's Wrath.
