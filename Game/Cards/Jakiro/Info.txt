Jakiro:
Most Pyrexae Dragons are hatched with one head, attuned to either ice or fire. 
Then there was Jakiro, an accident of nature. Possessing the might of both elements, 
the twin-headed dragon's Dual Breath freezes and burns simultaneously. Gobs of Liquid Frost or Liquid Fire 
adhere to armor and walls, melting down steel and stone alike. Retreating foes are blocked off with Ice Path, 
giving Jakiro ample time to roast them on his Macropyre.
