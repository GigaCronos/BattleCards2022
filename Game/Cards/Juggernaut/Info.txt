Juggernaut:
What laid under the Juggernaut's mask, none could say. The last of his kind, 
Yurnero carries alone the martial traditions of his native isle, now sunken forever beneath the waves. 
Dancing with his Blade, the Juggernaut elevates swordplay to an art form, 
Swiftly Slashing foes in an unstoppable Blade Fury, striking the most vulnerable spots. 
With skills honed to such perfection, Yurnero can keep on Slashing and Dashing between opponents 
while giving them absolutely no chance to retaliate even in the slightest. 
Their only option to escape this onslaught is to book it as quickly as possible. 
After eviscerating his foes, Yurnero places his portable mobile Healing Ward that emits 
meditative energies to revitalize himself and nearby allies.
