Sven:
The Rogue Knight lives by two creeds: Honor, as ordained by his own personal code, 
and Solitude. Always eager to charge into a fight. Using his iron gauntlet, 
he launches a Storm Hammer, stunning grouped enemies as he transports himself into battle, 
then closes in to cut them down with Great Cleave. Letting out a truly frightening Warcry, 
he ignites and calls upon God's Strength, a few swings of his gargantuan sword are 
often more than enough to slay on his hapless foes.
