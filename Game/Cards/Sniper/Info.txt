Sniper:
With a single bullet, Kardel Sharpeye pierced the steep-stalker's central eye from the valley floor, 
an ominous act that resulted in his ritual exile. He would win acclaim on a field of battle, or never return. 
Like his mountain kin, the Sniper is one with his firearm. He Takes Aim from great distances, and scores 
Headshots that stop his targets dead. Armed with a modular rifle, 
Kardel launches incendiary rounds to rain burning Shrapnel or throwing a 
Grenade knocking back his enemies over entrenched positions. 
No enemy is safe within the range of the Sniper's scope. As he pauses to line up his cross-hairs, 
compensating for every variable before he Assassinates his mark in one fatal shot.
