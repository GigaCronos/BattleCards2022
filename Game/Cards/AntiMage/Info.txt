AntiMage:
Among the ascetic monks of Turstarkuri, only a young acolyte was fortunate enough 
to escape the fallen legion's assault on the monastery. 
Now, vowing to eliminate not only the magic of the Dead God, 
the Anti-Mage returns to eradicate magic altogether. With sheer focus, 
he Counters Spells thrown at him, returning them to their senders. 
No wizard's trick is enough to contain or elude the Anti-Mage, as he Blinks out of any trap, 
while at the same time being capable of sending a Fragments of himself to pursue targets in return. 
With each swing of his unorthodox blades, the Anti-Mage steps closer to his goal of erradicating all magic, 
Breaking apart Mana, setting up the depleted caster to perish in a crushing Mana Void.
