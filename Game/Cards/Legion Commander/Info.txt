Legion Commander:
Renowned for her intrepid defense of Stonehall, the commander of the Bronze Legion 
swore a brutal vengeance upon its Abyssal Invaders. The call of Tresdin's horn Heals, 
Hastens and Inspires her soldiers. Faced with Overwhelming Odds, 
the commander calls down a spread of arrows from the archers of Stonehall. 
But above all, Tresdin relishes these one-on-one Duels. Locked in single combat, 
and with a Moment of Courage, she counter-strikes instinctively, 
slashing twice in the time her opponent takes to swing once. 
With each victory claimed, the Legion Commander adds to her strength, 
scaling her potential upwards without limit, until at last she can be a relentless one-woman army.
