Timbersaw:
Timbersaw had a good cause to be paranoid. Augury Bay fell to the walking trees, 
its inhabitants crushed under branch and bough. But that was the past. 
His new Saw-suit changed everything. Its long Timber Chain shot out, 
grasping the nearest trunk and pulling the suit towards it. In an instant, 
a dozen trees fell in a circle to the oversized saw. "Whirling Death, I'll call it!" 
But that was not all. A press of the button, and the bladed Chakram flew into the forest, 
cutting down even the sturdiest of hardwoods. Delirious with success, 
Rizzrack pulled up a Second Chakram and a Flamethrower, spinning and spewing in all directions, 
cackling until all that remained was a field of naked burned stumps. Now, he was ready to face his fears.
