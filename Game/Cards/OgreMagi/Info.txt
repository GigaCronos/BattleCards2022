Ogre Magi
Ogres were not known for their intelligence. Thankfully, a two-headed ogre is born once every generation, 
a blessed individual whose combined brainpower puts him on par with the dullest of single-headed creatures. 
What he lacks in wits, he makes up for with luck. The Ogre Magi possesses an innate chance to Multicast 
each ability they cast, Ignite enemies to cinder, quashing enemies by doubling, tripling, 
even quadrupling the damage from an Unrefined and simple Fireblast, boosting the power of his allies in a 
frenzied Bloodlust or protecting them in Orbs of Fire. Of course, luck can be difficult to rely upon...
