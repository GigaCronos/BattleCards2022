BristleBack:
The enforcer at a local pub, Rigwarl's never failed to collect a tab. 
That is, until he met one tough customer from the north. 
For the first time in his life, Rigwarl felt the need to train. 
His Thorny Back deters attacks while peppering foes with constant barrages of Quill Sprays. 
From his nose he blows Thick Gobs of Snot, slowing and covering opponents in goo. 
When it comes to a fight, he really puts his back into it. With every volley and every Sneeze, 
Rigwarl works himself into a fury, adding rage to each blow as he goes on the Warpath in search of a rematch.
