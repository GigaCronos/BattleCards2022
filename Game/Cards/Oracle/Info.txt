Oracle:
By carefully combining his intricate abilities, Oracle controls the destinies of both friend and foe. 
Dispelling both boons and curses, Fortune's End comes sooner than expected. Fate's Edict shelters 
heroes from magic, yet prevents them from raising arms. Purifying Flames stimulate regeneration, 
but not without the initial pains of cleansing. The Rain of Destiny shrouds threatened allies 
while causing harm to enemies. Knowledge of his abilities is key to utilize him as an ally at full potential; 
while he can defy destiny with False Promise and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, 
one mistake can potentially seal the fate of his allies.
