Dragon Knigth:
As Sir Davion slew Slyrak in arranged combat, the Eldwurm's blood mingled with his own,
sealing their essences together. He was no longer a dragon-slayer, 
but a Dragon Knight. The infusion of Dragon Blood caused his wounds to heal with inhuman speed, 
and granted him great new powers. While nowhere as grand as Slyrak, 
he found himself with the ability to Breathe Fire and launch Fireballs, immolating packs of foes at once. 
But when Davion took on his Elder Dragon Form, he became the formidable Eldwurm itself, 
and upon his awestruck enemies he rained projectiles of acid, fire, and ice.
